ðŸ“œ Pages Package Structure

- AllPages Class easies access to all page classes to be used during testing from a single place
- This structure guanties each page created as a singleton instance

- Used Logger interface for logging each action step within methods
- Implemented Page Object Model (POM) with PageFactory and @FindBy annotations to locate and initialize web elements efficiently.
- Encapsulated all the WebElements as private members
- Provided public getter methods for controlled access to elements when needed in test classes
- Called methods from utilites package -> ex. clickElement() , isWebElementDisplayed()  to reduce duplication

ðŸ“œ Test Package Structure

- Each page has its own test class, a test class has multiple test methods for each test case
- Followed a consistent structure as a startup in eact test method
- Applied Allure annotaions to imporve reporting quality and provide detailed reports 
      @Feature, @Story, @Owner, @Severity, @description
- Included Groups for grouped test executions by .xml files
- Utilized SoftAssert, to enable multiple assertion within a single test

- The user is navigated to the specified URL
- The necessary pages are accessed through the AllPages object
- A product is added to the basket on the product page
- The basket is opened, and it is checked whether the product is in the basket
- Validation is performed using SoftAssert
